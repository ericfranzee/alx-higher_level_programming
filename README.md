# Python - Hello World

> Each file in this repository contains code that demonstrates an important programming idea.
> Python scripts, variables, strings, and indices are all Python-specific terms.

## Description of files:

0. A shell script that executes a Python SCRIPT (export PYFILE=main.py).
1. a shell script that executes Python code (export PYCODE='print("Best School:."format(88+10))')
2. A Python script that displays the exact phrase "("Programming is like putting together a linguistic puzzle")"
3. print the integer contained in variable number, then Battery street.
4. print the variable number's float with a precision of two digits.
5. print three times a string stored in the variable str, followed by the first nine characters of that string.
6. print using the variables str1 and str2 7. modify and print string index range
7. display the updated variable without generating any new variables or string literals

9. Determine whether or not there is a linked list cycle/loop.
10. Write to stderr with a Python script that uses the sys module.
11. A shell script that generates a.pyc file.
12. Create a Python function that performs the same function as the following bytecode:

```
 3 .. 0 LOAD_CONST .... 1 (98)
 .... 3 LOAD_FAST ..... 0 (a)
 .... 6 LOAD_FAST ..... 1 (b)
 .... 9 BINARY_POWER
 ....10 BINARY_ADD
 ....11 RETURN_VALUE
```
